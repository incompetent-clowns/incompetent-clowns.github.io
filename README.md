# Incompetent Clowns

Welcome to our webpage! We are a bunch of incompetent clowns, trying to become competent. We have a few projects in the works. We detail these below and add updates as we progress.

## Prototypes/links
  * [Project T](https://incompetent-clowns.github.io/t): A barebones Epub file reader, with side-by-side on-device translation. Here's the [project page](https://github.com/incompetent-clowns/incompetent-clowns.github.io/tree/main/t#project-t).
  * WebRTC and OpenAuth based P2P call:
     * [Web Client](https://toAtulArora.github.io/1.html): This allows you to use your Google address to authenticate and make P2P calls to people using their email addresses. Doesn't work with mobile data yet (need to add TURN servers).
     * [Web Server](https://webrtc-signalling-backend.onrender.com/): This can sometimes take literally a minute or two to initialise (if the server hasn't been used in a while)

## Chronology

### Plan
* February 2026:
  * Migrate everything to the new GitHub organisation and recover previous functionality.
  * Get the ESP32 to allow the user to input a WiFi SSID and password, connect to the internet, and to the server, ready to receive instructions.

### Past
* January 2026:
  * Managed to reconstruct the ESP32 based robot-car project described [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWnTYl4Br-E).
  * Managed to get WebRTC to work on two different devices, with a nodeJS based authentication mechanism (relying on OpenAuth and Google emails); TURN servers remain to be implemented. Used ```onrender``` to host the server for now. 
  * Making progress with learning FreeCAD.
  * Streamlining the projects into a single new GitHub organisation.

## Active
* [Spineless](https://github.com/incompetent-clowns/spineless/): Supposed to be a minimal NodeJS server for testing our projects. 
* [Robot-car](https://github.com/incompetent-clowns/robot-car): Supposed to be a polished, open-design/open-source (for non-commercial use) small robot car—built around an Android phone—that acts as a telepresence robot. The focus is privacy (the code will be online for anyone to check), ease of use, and affordable. The primary motivation being able to be "ambiently present" around loved ones.


## Wish-list
* Lumen: TBA
* Bus live location: TBA
* Anti-surveillance Crowd-sourced Traffic Safety (ACT-safe): TBA (ambitious)

## The Clowns

* [Atul Singh Arora](https://atulsingharora.github.io/)
* His imaginary friends.
