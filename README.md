# Incompetent Clowns

Welcome to our webpage! We are a bunch of incompetent clowns, trying to become competent. We have a few projects in the works. We list them below and add details as we progress.

## Chronology
* January 2026:
  * Managed to reconstruct the ESP32 based robot-car project described [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWnTYl4Br-E).
  * Managed to get WebRTC to work on two different devices, with a nodeJS based authentication mechanism (relying on OpenAuth and Google emails); TURN servers remain to be implemented. Used ```onrender``` to host the server for now. 
  * Making progress with learning FreeCAD.
  * Streamlining the projects into a single new GitHub organisation.
 
* *Plan* February 2026:
  * Migrate everything to the new GitHub organisation and recover previous functionality.
  * Get the ESP32 to allow the user to input a WiFi SSID and password, connect to the internet, and to the server, ready to receive instructions.


## Active
* [Spineless](https://github.com/incompetent-clowns/spineless/): Supposed to be a minimal NodeJS server for testing our projects. 
* [Robot-car](https://github.com/incompetent-clowns/robot-car): Supposed to be a polished, open-design/open-source (for non-commercial use) small robot car—built around an Android phone—that acts as a telepresence robot. The focus is privacy (the code will be online for anyone to check), ease of use, and affordable. The primary motivation being able to be "ambiently present" around loved ones. 

## Wish-list
* Lumen: TBA
* Bus live location: TBA
* Anti-surveillance Crowd-sourced Traffic Safety (ACT-safe): TBA (ambitious)
