# Incompetent Clowns

Welcome to our webpage! We are a bunch of incompetent clowns, trying to become competent. We have a few projects in the works. We list them below and add details as we progress.

## Chronology
* January 2026:
  * Managed to reconstruct the project described [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWnTYl4Br-E).
  * Managed to get WebRTC to work on two different devices, with a nodeJS based authentication mechanism (relying on OpenAuth and Google emails); TURN servers remain to be implemented.
  * Making progress with learning FreeCAD.

## Active
* [Spineless](https://github.com/incompetent-clowns/spineless/): Supposed to be a minimal NodeJS server for testing our projects.
* [Robot-car](https://github.com/incompetent-clowns/robot-car): Supposed to be a polished, open-design/open-source (for non-commercial use) small robot car—built around an Android phone—that acts as a telepresence robot. The focus is privacy (the code will be online for anyone to check), ease of use, and affordable. The primary motivation being able to be "ambiently present" around loved ones. 

## Wish-list
* Lumen: TBA
* Bus live location: TBA
* Anti-surveillance Crowd-sourced Traffic Safety (ACT-safe): TBA (ambitious)
